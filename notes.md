Emmet VScode Extension docs https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/

Chrome Web Developer Extension (https://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) provides tools like:

- css validator
- html validator
- accessability validator/wave tool (https://wave.webaim.org/)

The above features do not work when using the go live feature in VScode. If you try to use either of these you'll get an error so push your code to github pages before validating.

Box Sizing 101
We have two methods for box sizing:
The Content Box Method & The Border Box Method.

- The content box method adds padding, border width, and margin to THE OUTSIDE of an element.

- The border box method adds ONLY MARGIN TO THE OUTSIDE, and border width and padding is subtracted from the inside of the box.
